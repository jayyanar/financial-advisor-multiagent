# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing financial advisor multiagent system (`financial_advisor_multiagent.py`) to be deployed on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. The current system uses the Strands Agents framework with a hierarchical orchestration pattern and needs to be adapted to work with AgentCore's runtime service contract while maintaining all existing functionality and educational disclaimers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the financial advisor system to AgentCore Runtime, so that I can leverage AWS's managed infrastructure for scalable agent hosting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed to AgentCore THEN it SHALL maintain all existing financial advisory capabilities
2. WHEN a user invokes the deployed agent THEN it SHALL provide the same comprehensive analysis workflow (market intelligence, strategy development, execution planning, risk assessment)
3. WHEN the agent processes requests THEN it SHALL include all educational disclaimers and responsible AI practices
4. WHEN the system runs on AgentCore THEN it SHALL use the existing virtual environment dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AgentCore-compatible version to follow the required runtime patterns, so that it integrates properly with AgentCore's service contract.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the AgentCore version THEN the system SHALL use `BedrockAgentCoreApp` wrapper
2. WHEN defining the entry point THEN it SHALL use the `@app.entrypoint` decorator
3. WHEN the agent starts THEN it SHALL use `app.run()` for runtime control
4. WHEN processing requests THEN it SHALL accept payload format with "prompt" field
5. WHEN returning responses THEN it SHALL return structured JSON with "result" field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing multi-agent architecture, so that the system preserves its specialized agent capabilities and orchestration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is converted THEN it SHALL preserve the FinancialAdvisorOrchestrator class
2. WHEN agents are initialized THEN it SHALL maintain all four specialist agents (market intelligence, strategy architect, execution planner, risk assessor)
3. WHEN processing requests THEN it SHALL use the same agent tools and coordination logic
4. WHEN invoking specialist agents THEN it SHALL maintain the 2000-token conservative limits
5. WHEN handling errors THEN it SHALL preserve the robust fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency management for AgentCore deployment, so that the system can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the deployment package THEN it SHALL include a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN specifying dependencies THEN it SHALL include `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` for runtime support
3. WHEN listing Strands dependencies THEN it SHALL use `strands-agents-tools` (not `strands-tools`)
4. WHEN including web search THEN it SHALL maintain `duckduckgo-search` dependency
5. WHEN the system deploys THEN it SHALL work with the existing virtual environment setup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the AgentCore version locally before deployment, so that I can verify functionality and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL start on localhost:8080
2. WHEN testing locally THEN it SHALL accept HTTP POST requests to /invocations endpoint
3. WHEN receiving test requests THEN it SHALL process JSON payloads with "prompt" field
4. WHEN responding to tests THEN it SHALL return proper JSON responses
5. WHEN local testing completes THEN it SHALL be ready for AgentCore deployment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment automation through AgentCore CLI, so that I can easily deploy and manage the agent in AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring deployment THEN it SHALL use `agentcore configure` with the converted entry point
2. WHEN launching to AWS THEN it SHALL use `agentcore launch` for automatic resource creation
3. WHEN testing deployment THEN it SHALL support `agentcore invoke` for remote testing
4. WHEN the agent is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible through AgentCore's managed infrastructure
5. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL maintain all original functionality in the cloud environment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deployed agent to handle various input formats gracefully, so that I can interact with it using different query styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving simple queries THEN the system SHALL extract ticker, risk attitude, and horizon information
2. WHEN receiving incomplete information THEN it SHALL request missing parameters appropriately
3. WHEN processing complete requests THEN it SHALL run the full analysis workflow
4. WHEN handling errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN responding THEN it SHALL maintain the educational disclaimer format

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the deployed agent effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN agent invocations fail THEN it SHALL use the existing fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN web search fails THEN it SHALL handle rate limits and API errors gracefully
4. WHEN token limits are exceeded THEN it SHALL truncate inputs appropriately
5. WHEN exceptions occur THEN it SHALL return structured error responses instead of crashing
