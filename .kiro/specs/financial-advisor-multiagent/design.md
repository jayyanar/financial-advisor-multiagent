# Design Document

## Overview

The Financial Advisor Multiagent System implements a sophisticated "Agents as Tools" pattern using the Strands Agents SDK. The system consists of a primary orchestrator agent that coordinates four specialized sub-agents to provide comprehensive financial advisory services. This design follows the hierarchical delegation pattern where a financial coordinator manages specialized agents for data analysis, trading strategy development, execution planning, and risk assessment.

The system is designed as an educational tool that guides users through a structured financial advisory process while maintaining clear disclaimers about the educational nature of the advice provided.

### Agent Hierarchy

1. **Financial Coordinator Agent** (Primary Orchestrator)
   - Manages user interaction and workflow orchestration
   - Routes requests to appropriate specialized agents
   - Maintains conversation state and context
   - Provides introductions and disclaimers

2. **Data Analyst Agent** (Specialized Tool Agent)
   - Performs market research using DuckDuckGo Search
   - Generates comprehensive market analysis reports
   - Focuses on SEC filings, news, and analyst commentary

3. **Trading Analyst Agent** (Specialized Tool Agent)
   - Develops tailored trading strategies
   - Aligns strategies with user risk profile and timeline
   - Provides detailed strategy analysis and rationale

4. **Execution Analyst Agent** (Specialized Tool Agent)
   - Creates detailed execution plans
   - Defines order types, position sizing, and risk management
   - Provides tactical implementation guidance

5. **Risk Analyst Agent** (Specialized Tool Agent)
   - Evaluates overall risk profile
   - Assesses alignment with user preferences
   - Provides comprehensive risk analysis and recommendations

## Components and Interfaces

### Agent Configuration

#### Financial Coordinator Agent
```python
financial_coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="financial_coordinator",
    model=MODEL,
    description="Guide users through structured financial advisory process",
    instruction=FINANCIAL_COORDINATOR_PROMPT,
    output_key="financial_coordinator_output",
    tools=[
        AgentTool(agent=data_analyst_agent),
        AgentTool(agent=trading_analyst_agent),
        AgentTool(agent=execution_analyst_agent),
        AgentTool(agent=risk_analyst_agent),
    ]
)
```

#### Specialized Agents
Each specialized agent follows this pattern:
```python
agent = LlmAgent(
    model=MODEL,
    name="agent_name",
    description="Agent description",
    instruction="Detailed prompt with role and responsibilities",
    output_key="unique_output_key",
    tools=[relevant_tools]  # Only data_analyst has Google Search
)
```

### State Management

The system uses output keys to maintain state between agent interactions:

- `market_data_analysis_output`: Market research and analysis data
- `proposed_trading_strategies_output`: Generated trading strategies
- `execution_plan_output`: Detailed execution plans
- `final_risk_assessment_output`: Comprehensive risk analysis

### Tool Integration

#### DuckDuckGo Search Tool
- Used exclusively by the Data Analyst Agent
- Performs market research and data gathering
- Targets recent information (configurable timeframe)
- Gathers multiple sources for comprehensive analysis

#### AgentTool Wrapper
- Wraps specialized agents as callable tools
- Enables the coordinator to invoke sub-agents
- Maintains proper state passing between agents
