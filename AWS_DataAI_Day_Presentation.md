## 🚀 **The Complete Journey: From Concept to Cloud**

### **Stage 1: Foundation with MCP Server**
```
💡 Idea → 🤖 Kiro →  Add MCP → 📝 Natural Language Prompt → ⚡ Working Code
```

**Key Message**: "I started with just an idea and a simple prompt to Kiro"

---

### **Stage 2: Strands Agent Creation ipynb Notebook**
```
🎯 Basic Prompt → 🔧 Strands Framework → 🤖 Financial Advisor Agent → ✅ Working Solution
```

Build a 4-step multi-agent Financial Advisor using Strands.

Coordinator guides user through:
1) Market Analysis → 2) Trading Strategies → 3) Execution Plan → 4) Risk Review.

Each step uses a subagent:
- data_analyst_agent: gathers news + SEC data for provided_ticker.
- trading_analyst_agent: builds 5+ strategies based on risk & time horizon.
- execution_analyst_agent: turns strategies into an execution plan.
- risk_analyst_agent: reviews total risk & profile alignment.

Show this intro:
“Hello! I’ll guide you through financial analysis, strategy, execution, and risk. Say 'show me markdown' anytime. Ready to start?”

Show this disclaimer (and append to every agent's output):
“This is educational only, not financial advice. Past performance ≠ future results. Consult a qualified advisor.”

Use shared state: provided_ticker, user_risk_attitude, user_investment_period, outputs from each step.

Coordinator runs agents in order, passes state, summarizes outputs.
