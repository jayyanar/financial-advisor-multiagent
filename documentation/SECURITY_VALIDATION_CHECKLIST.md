# Security Validation Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Validation

Use this checklist to validate security measures before deploying the AgentCore financial advisor system.

### ✅ Credential Security
- [ ] No hardcoded AWS credentials in source code
- [ ] No API keys or secrets in configuration files
- [ ] Environment variables used for all sensitive configuration
- [ ] IAM roles configured with minimal required permissions
- [ ] AWS credential rotation schedule established

### ✅ Input Validation
- [ ] User input sanitization implemented in `process_agentcore_payload()`
- [ ] Input length limits enforced (5000 characters maximum)
- [ ] Payload structure validation in place
- [ ] Type checking for all input fields
- [ ] Special character handling implemented

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Sanitized error messages for users (no stack traces exposed)
- [ ] Detailed error logging for developers (using app.logger)
- [ ] Structured error response format implemented
- [ ] No sensitive information in error responses
- [ ] Graceful degradation for all failure scenarios

### ✅ External API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for DuckDuckGo search
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] API timeout handling configured
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] No API keys exposed in logs or responses

### ✅ Token Management
- [ ] Conservative 2000-token limits implemented
- [ ] Token usage monitoring in place
- [ ] Input truncation for long queries
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Resource exhaustion prevention

### ✅ AgentCore Integration Security
- [ ] Payload validation with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Structured error responses without information disclosure
- [ ] Security event logging through AgentCore
- [ ] Input sanitization before processing
- [ ] Response metadata includes security indicators

### ✅ Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Security event logging configured
- [ ] Token usage monitoring implemented
- [ ] Error rate monitoring in place
- [ ] Alert thresholds established
- [ ] Log retention policies defined

## Security Testing Commands

### 1. Input Validation Testing
```bash
# Test with oversized input
python -c "
import json
payload = {'prompt': 'A' * 10000}
print('Testing oversized input:', len(payload['prompt']), 'characters')
"

# Test with invalid payload structure
python -c "
import json
payload = {'invalid_field': 'test'}
print('Testing invalid payload structure')
"
```

### 2. Error Handling Testing
```bash
# Test error response format
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"invalid": "payload"}' | jq .

# Test empty payload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' | jq .
```

### 3. Security Scanning
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "AKIA[A-Z0-9]\{16\}" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "aws_access_key_id\s*=" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "aws_secret_access_key\s*=" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Check for potential security issues
bandit -r financial_advisor_agentcore.py
safety check -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Token Usage Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor token usage patterns
python -c "
from financial_advisor_agentcore import app
# Test with various query lengths
queries = ['Short query', 'Medium length query with more details', 'Very long query with extensive details about financial analysis requirements and specific parameters']
for query in queries:
    print(f'Query length: {len(query)} characters')
"
```

## Security Incident Response

### Immediate Actions
1. **Credential Compromise**:
   - Rotate all AWS credentials immediately
   - Disable compromised IAM roles/users
   - Review CloudTrail logs for unauthorized access

2. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - Check AgentCore logs for unusual patterns
   - Monitor token usage for anomalies
   - Review error rates and response times

3. **System Compromise**:
   - Stop AgentCore deployment if necessary
   - Preserve logs for forensic analysis
   - Implement additional monitoring

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Update Security Configurations**:
   - Implement additional input validation
   - Enhance error handling
   - Update monitoring thresholds

2. **Redeploy with Enhanced Security**:
   - Use updated security configurations
   - Implement additional rate limiting
   - Add enhanced logging

## Compliance Verification

### Educational Use Compliance
- [ ] Educational disclaimers present in all outputs
- [ ] No licensed financial advice provided
- [ ] Clear warnings about consulting qualified advisors
- [ ] Risk warnings included in all strategies

### Data Protection Compliance
- [ ] No PII storage or processing
- [ ] Session isolation between users
- [ ] No persistent storage of user queries
- [ ] Secure handling of temporary data

### AWS Security Standards
- [ ] IAM best practices followed
- [ ] Network security properly configured
- [ ] Encryption in transit enabled
- [ ] CloudTrail logging enabled

## Security Review Schedule
